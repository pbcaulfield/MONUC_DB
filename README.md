# MONUC_DB

Web based DB, with PHP/sql for managing rental/hire of dive gear.

##Minimum Viable Product

1. Allow adding a member
2. Allow renting gear
3. Information is placed into the DB
5. Sort of pretty
6. Payment tracking system (somehow)
7. Use bootstrap and ensure site is optimised for phones

##Nice to Have

1. Admin Back End
  - Important to ensure that product can be continued, so significant effort in documentation and flexibility in coding and system management from an admin back end would be nice to have
  - Also important to allow admins to see hot items and product deficiencies
2. Data checking
  - Ensuring that members are active and current members
3. Report for finance (emailed)
4. Report for Gear officer (emailed)
5. Report for president (emailed)
